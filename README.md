Airline Passenger Satisfaction analysis 

For my first Python Data Analysis Project, I decided to use the dataset “Airline Passenger Satisfaction” from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/teejmahal20/airline-passenger-satisfaction). 
This dataset contains an airline passenger satisfaction survey (statistical data) which we will use to apply different python commands/techniques learned in class.
